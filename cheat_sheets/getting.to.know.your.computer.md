# Getting to know your computer

The purpose of this document is to get you familiar with some basic concepts of computing which will ease your journey on this course.

## File structure

All data on your computer is stored on your hard drive. Each file object on your computer is one of the following types.
* A directory, or a folder - a container for other file objects
* A file
  * A binary file - data meant for a computer program to understand
    * A computer program, or 'executable'
    * A proprietary format (e.g. Powerpoint file)
    * An open format (e.g. jpeg, gif)
  * A text file - data meant to be human readable (and possibly can be interpreted by a computer as well)
    * Plain text file
    * Computer program source code
    * Configuration settings
* A shortcut, or a link - a logical pointer to another file object

All desktop computer systems have an installed program called a *file explorer*:
* Windows has *Windows Explorer*
* Macs have *Finder*
* Linux has any number of them, for example *Nemo*, *Nautilus*, *Thunar*

## Command line

Traditionally, the command line is a text interface for communicating directly with the computer. The truth is slightly more complicated for Windows, but this statement is still true for Unix systems (which includes Macs and Linux).

An overview of the command line can be found [here](./cli.md).

## Keyboard shortcuts

Generally, the more you can do with your computer without touching your mouse, the more productive you will be. To start with, you should be able to do the following tasks without touching the mouse.

Keyboard shortcuts on Linux will depend on your desktop environment, but most of them will have the same keyboard shortcuts as Windows. Even better, Linux desktop environments are likely to allow you to change your keyboard shortcuts as you see fit.

### Start a program

* On Windows, press the START button
* On Mac, press CMD+SPACE
* Start typing the name of your program
* Use the arrow keys to select the program you want to start
* Press ENTER to start the program

### Switch between windows

* On Windows, press and hold ALT
* On Mac, press and hold CMD
* To switch forwards, tap the TAB key
* To switch backwards, press and hold the SHIFT key, and tap the TAB key
* When you've highlighted the window you want to switch to, release all keys
